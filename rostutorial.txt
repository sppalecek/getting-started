Magnetic Calibration
Kill the submarine (by pressing 1)
Start recording raw magnetic data (rosbag record /imu/mag_raw)
Rotate the submarine, sampling every possible rotation (look at subsim's README.md)
Stop recording (press Ctrl-c on rosbag)
Generate the calibration result (rosrun magnetic_hardsoft_compensation generate_config NAME_OF_THE_BAG_FILE_YOU_PRODUCED). Make sure that the points cover the entire sphere. If they don't, re-record the data. Close the window.
Paste the generated configuration (the last 5 lines of output after closing the window) into sub_launch/launch/common.xml, replacing the similar 5 lines that are already there.
Stop and restart the main "roslaunch subsim run.launch" process to load the new configuration.
